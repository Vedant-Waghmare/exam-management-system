Exam Management System

Developed an Exam Management System that enables teachers to efficiently manage exam questions and allows students to take exams in a structured and interactive manner. This system provides role-based access for teachers and students, ensuring secure authentication and user-specific functionalities.
Technologies Used:
ðŸ”¹ Java (OOP principles) â€“ Core programming language used for backend logic.
ðŸ”¹ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) â€“ Facilitates communication with MySQL.
ðŸ”¹ MySQL Database â€“ Stores exam questions and student responses.
ðŸ”¹ Eclipse IDE â€“ Used for development, debugging, and project management.

The project consists of three main components:
1. Teacher Module â€“ Teachers can add, delete, and view questions stored in a database.
2. Student Module â€“ Students can log in, attempt exams, and receive instant feedback.
3. Database Management Module â€“ Manages question storage and retrieval through MySQL integration.

Key Features:

âœ… Role-based authentication â€“ Separate login for teachers and students with credential validation.

âœ… Question Management â€“ Teachers can add, remove, and view questions dynamically.

âœ… Exam Interface â€“ Students can attempt multiple-choice questions and receive instant feedback.

âœ… Database Integration â€“ Questions and answers are stored in a MySQL database for persistence.

âœ… Menu-Driven Interface â€“ Simplified console-based interaction for seamless navigation.

Impact & Learning:

ðŸ”¹ Gained hands-on experience with Java, database management, and user authentication.

ðŸ”¹ Improved my understanding of JDBC, SQL queries, and object-oriented programming concepts.

ðŸ”¹ Collaborating with Ankita Yadav on this project was a truly enriching experience. Working together helped enhance problem-solving approaches and foster a great learning environment.
